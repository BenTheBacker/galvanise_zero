rationalise mess
----------------
* remove temporary code kicking around, and clean up repo

* create puct_v2 and add to repo

* similar to gurgeh and puct

* uses traversals/visits

* has transpositions


match mode
----------
* batching

  * new scheduler (initially w/o LR)

  * virtual visits and virtual loss [midpoint(next move / 0.25 of current value) not zero]

* pondering

  * maximum number of visits to "top_visits" (possibly == num evaluations)

  * always converge, ie doesn't use approximate converge hack


* better runtime stats and reporting logic (where logic reporting is not a a hack)

* play out tree when no turn ???

* cached position (memory only)  ???

  * future could cache tree to disk  ???



evaluation mode
---------------
* just a script with X vs Y using gamemaster with ponder mode (should be fast)

* round robin tournament mode of different generations

* elo and bayesian elo

* pretty pictures of graphs
