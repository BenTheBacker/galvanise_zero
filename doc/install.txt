brief and probably inadequate build instructions
================================================

ggplib install instructions uses pypy, which is nice for speed to build some of large networks.
The propnets are cached, and can then be accessed by python2.  So best to run perftest.sh in ggplib
before going any further (as will cache breakthrough/reversi)

ggp-zero uses tensorflow/keras/numpy, all things which it is better to use python2 for.
I would highly recommend using pip and controlling your own pip installs for tensorflow, especially
if using combination of cpu/gpu.

.. code-block:: shell

    # INSTALL:
    sudo apt install python python-dev

    # where you want to install tensorflow etc
    mkdir ~/bin/install

    # install tensorflow as per https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux
    virtualenv --system-site-packages ~/bin/install/py2_tf_cpu
    virtualenv --system-site-packages ~/bin/install/py2_tf_gpu

    # instructions pretty much same for both
    . ~/bin/install/py2_tf_cpu/bin/activate

    pip install twisted cffi pytest tabulate
    pip install numpy future

    # choose one of:
    pip install --upgrade tensorflow
    pip install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu

    pip install keras h5py


    # COMMON SETUP
    # put these in shell script/bash alias or something.  I use two bash alias, and switch between cpu/gpu.

    alias ggpzerocpu='export GGPLIB_PATH=~/ggplib && . ~/ggp-zero/bin/setup.sh && . ~/bin/install/_p2_tf/bin/activate'
    alias ggpzerogpu='export GGPLIB_PATH=~/ggplib && . ~/ggp-zero/bin/setup.sh && . ~/bin/install/_p2_tf/bin/activate'


    # TRAIN:

    # for training server:
    cd ggp-zero/src/ggpzero/distributed
    python server.py somefile.conf

    # ctrc-c and edit/configure somefile.conf
    python server.py somefile.conf

    # for training worker:
    cd ggp-zero/src/ggpzero/distributed
    python server.py worker.conf

    # ctrc-c and edit/configure worker.conf
    python server.py worker.conf



    # TO RUN MODEL

    cd ggp-zero/src/ggpzero/player
    python puctplayer.py <port> <gen>

    # eg:
    python puctplayer.py 9147 v6_40
