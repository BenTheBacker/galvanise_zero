ggpzero/gzero/galvanise
=======================
gzero provides a framework for neural networks to learn to play solely based on self-play.  This
is loosely based on the papers of AlphaZero and exIT, and a number of zero open source were greatly
inspirational.

The name gzero stems from the fact that this project was initially a spin off my galvanise player
in GGP.

Status September 2018
-------------------
Games trained for > 5 days (from most recent)

* go(baduk) 9x9 (no super ko, statemachine in c++)
* chess (with no 50 rule)
* connect 6
* amazons
* hex (11 and 13 board sizes)
* reversi (8 and 10 board sizes)
* breakthrough

See https://github.com/richemslie/ggp-zero/blob/dev/src/ggpzero/defs/gamedesc.py for full list.

Amazons and Breakthrough are the winners of the ICGA 2018 Computer Olympiad.  Chess and Go are
reasonably strong, but no where near the level one could achieve if spending 100s of GPU days
training.

Go 9x9 has a rating 2560 elo on CGOS after about a week of training.

Chess was harder to test due to not having 50 rule, but somewhere about 2200-2600 elo would be my
best guess.

Also, Chess and Connect6 "cheated" as experimented with adding some data from historical games
during the self play.

--------------------

The project is currently on hiatus.

The code is in fairly good shape, but could do with some refactoring and
documentation (especially a how to guide on how to train a game).  It would definitely be good to
have an extra pair of eyes on it.  I'll welcome and support anyone willing to try training a game
for themselves.  Some notes:

1. python is 2.7
2. requires a GPU/tensorflow
3. good starting point is https://github.com/richemslie/ggp-zero/blob/dev/src/ggpzero/defs
4. the self play method is very different from A0, and not documented anywhere.  the code is here:
    https://github.com/richemslie/ggp-zero/blob/dev/src/cpp/selfplay.cpp
5. cpp puct/puct2 really needs to be combined.

project goal(s)
---------------
The initial goal of this project was to be able to train any game in
[GGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_game_playing) ecosystem, to play at a higher level than
the state of the art GGP players, given some (relatively) small time frame to train the game (a few
days to a week, on commodity hardware - and not months/years worth of training time on hundreds of
GPUs).

Some game types which are completely unsupported right now:

* non-zero board games (such as non zero sum variant of Skirmish)
* multiplayer games
* games that are not easily represented as a 2D array of channels
* simultaneous games
* single player games (puzzles)

-------------
* ggpzero is extension of [ggplib](https://github.com/ggplib/ggplib)
* Models can be found [here](https://github.com/richemslie/gzero_data)
* Custom games, game specific code (*) can be found [here](https://github.com/richemslie/gzero_games)


(*)  Most game specific game is for testing purposes, printing the board to console, or connecting
to platforms/programs, such as GTP in go and UCI in chess.  State machines for go(Baduk) and
Internation Draughts are written in C++.
